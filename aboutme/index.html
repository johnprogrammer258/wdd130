    <p>Hello everyone, I hope you all are having a great start of the semester.</p> 
    <p>My name is Jonathan Dominguez, I'm from Tlaxcala, Mexico; but am living in Avondale, AZ currently. 
    I got married 2 years ago, and we have a year and a half old baby girl. My wife, Priscila, is from Tuxtla Gutierrez, Mexico. 
    They are living right there currently. So, we have a distance relationship, 
    and to be honest with you all, it is too hard because we miss each other all the time, every day.</p> 
    <p>When I came to the United States, almost 4 years ago, I had fear.</p> 
    <p>I didn't know to speak English and that was one of my greatest fears. 
    However, it took me time to learn, I mean, my language skills are not the best right now, 
    but it is better than before.</p>
    <p>I was working in the construction field since march 2019, but on May 2022, 
    when I was almost finishing BYU Pathway Connect, I felt more comfortable with the language and 
    I decided to apply for a new job. Fortunately, I get a new job in Amazon on May 2022 and it is where I do work currently. 
    I have learned new communication skills in this job and found great people there, 
    who are helping me to grow in my career.</p> 
    <p>Thanks for reading me, it is a pleasure to have the opportunity to know you all 
    and be part of this course. Best wishes to all of you.</p>
